this is just a list of random tweaks that i like using

make steam open library by default

steam menu > settings > interface > start up location

stop steam from opening the news window

steam menu > settings > interface > notify me about additions or changes to my games, new releases and upcoming releases
(if this box is already unchecked just check and uncheck it)
